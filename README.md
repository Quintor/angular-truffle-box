# Truffle Box for Angular

This Truffle Box provides a base for working with the Truffle Framework and Angular.
It provides a basic working example of the MetaCoin contracts with Angular components.
This project is generated with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Prerequisites

In order to run the Truffle box, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (tested with version 10.x.y). This will include `npm`, needed
to install dependencies. In order install these dependencies, you will also need [Python](https://www.python.org) (version 2.7.x) and
[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will also need the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) plugin for Chrome.

## Building

1. Install truffle, Angular CLI and an Ethereum client. If you don't have a test environment, we recommend ganache-cli
  ```bash
  npm install -g truffle
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  npm install -g ganache-cli
  ```

2. Download the box.
  ```bash
  truffle unbox Quintor/angular-truffle-box
  ```

3. Run your Ethereum client. For Ganache CLI:
  ```bash
  ganache-cli
  ```
Note the mnemonic 12-word phrase printed on startup, you will need it later.

4. Compile and migrate your contracts.
  ```bash
  truffle compile && truffle migrate
  ```

## Configuration
1. In order to connect with the Ethereum network, you will need to configure MetaMask
2. Log into the `ganache-cli` test accounts in MetaMask, using the 12-word phrase printed earlier.
    1. A detailed explaination of how to do this can be found [here](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask)
        1. Normally, the available test accounts will change whenever you restart `ganache-cli`.
        2. In order to receive the same test accounts every time you start `ganache-cli`, start it with a seed like this: `ganache-cli --seed 0` or `ganache-cli -m "put your mnemonic phrase here needs twelve words to work with MetaMask"`
3. Point MetaMask to `ganache-cli` by connecting to the network `localhost:8545` 


## Running

1. Run the app using Angular CLI:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
The app is now served on localhost:4200

2. Making sure you have configured MetaMask, visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

3. Send MetaCoins!

## Testing

1. Running the Angular component tests:
  ```bash
  ng test
  ```

2. Running the Truffle tests:
  ```bash
  truffle test
  ```

3. Running Protactor end-to-end tests

  ```bash
  ng e2e
  ```
## Releasing
Using the Angular CLI you can build a distributable of your app. Will be placed in `dist/`

  ```bash
  ng build
  ```

## FAQ

* __Where can I find more documentation?__

This Truffle box is a union of [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and an Angular setup created with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).
For solidity compilation and Ethereum related issues, try the [Truffle documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/).
For Angular CLI and typescript issues, refer to the [Angular CLI documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki)

* __Common errors and their solutions__

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../../../build/contracts/MetaCoin.json'` during `ng serve` | Run `truffle compile` |
| `Error: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce.` in MetaMask | Reset MetaMask: Settings -> Reset Account |
| `Error getting balance; see log.` in UI, with `Error: MetaCoin has not been deployed to detected network (network/artifact mismatch)` in browser console | Ensure you have started ganache, run `truffle migrate` and configured MetaMask to point to ganache |



* __How do I get this to work on Windows?__

Possible issues:

- If you're missing a C++ compiler, run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` in a cmd with administrative rights.
- If the `truffle.js` file opens when you're trying to run truffle commands, rename the file to `truffle-config.js`
